# Contribute

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

If you're a contributor and feel you're ready for it, contact RedBot for the "creator" user rank on RedGuides.com

Not every contribution has to be MacroQuest related, we've hosted many other programs for EverQuest. 

If you're contributing something new, or know about good EverQuest software that we don't, please create a "resource" for it here:
https://www.redguides.com/community/resources/add

If your project needs to be compiled, (e.g. it's a plugin) it will need to go through code review. Please contact Redbot or Sic with a link to your resource.
